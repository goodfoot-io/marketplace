# Custom slash commands

> Define frequently-used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute.

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently-used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.

## Syntax

```
/<command-name> [arguments]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<command-name>` | Name derived from the Markdown filename (without `.md` extension) |
| `[arguments]`    | Optional arguments passed to the command                          |

## Command types

### Project commands

Commands stored in your repository and shared with your team. When listed in `/help`, these commands show "(project)" after their description.

**Location**: `.claude/commands/`

In the following example, we create the `/optimize` command:

```bash
# Create a project command
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

### Personal commands

Commands available across all your projects. When listed in `/help`, these commands show "(user)" after their description.

**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`

In the following example, we create the `/security-review` command:

```bash
# Create a personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

## Features

### Namespacing

Organize commands in subdirectories. The subdirectories determine the command's
full name. The description will show whether the command comes from the project
directory (`.claude/commands`) or the user-level directory (`~/.claude/commands`).

Conflicts between user and project level commands are not supported. Otherwise,
multiple commands with the same base file name can coexist.

For example, a file at `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates the command `/frontend:component` with description showing "(project)".
Meanwhile, a file at `~/.claude/commands/component.md` creates the command `/component` with description showing "(user)".

### Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

For example:

```bash
# Command definition
echo 'Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards' > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

# Usage
> /fix-issue 123
```

### Bash command execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix. The output is included in the command context. You *must* include `allowed-tools` with the `Bash` tool, but you can choose the specific bash commands to allow.

For example:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

### File references

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix to [reference files](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#reference-files-and-directories).

For example:

```markdown
# Reference a specific file
Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files
Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

### Thinking mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including [extended thinking keywords](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking).

## File format

Command files support:

* **Markdown format** (`.md` extension)
* **YAML frontmatter** for metadata:
  * `allowed-tools`: List of tools the command can use
  * `description`: Brief description of the command
  * `argument-hint`: The arguments expected for the slash command. Example: `argument-hint: add [tagId] | remove [tagId] | list`. This hint is shown to the user when auto-completing the slash command.
* **Dynamic content** with bash commands (`!`) and file references (`@`)
* **Prompt instructions** as the main content
