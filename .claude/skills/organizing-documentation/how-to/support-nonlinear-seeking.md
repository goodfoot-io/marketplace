# How to support nonlinear information seeking

Scope: serve readers who grep, jump, blame, and retrieve rather than read top-to-bottom. How-to (author stage). Applies Principle 7.

## 1. Model the journeys

Build a path for each: beginner, expert, debugging, incident, onboarding, design-decision, compliance-review, migration, customer-support, and direct-arrival — through hubs, topics, cross-links, and external entry points.

## 2. Support berrypicking

Add summaries, snippets, examples, and related links so readers accumulate partial answers; add reformulation cues and next links; add right-neighborhood and wrong-place clues; recover from wrong terms with scoped aliases and disambiguation; make chunks self-contained (title, scope, source-of-truth context) for extraction; berrypick a region's history with `git blame` and `git log -L`.

## 3. Add recovery links

Back-to-overview on deep pages; related-tasks after concepts and references; common-problems near risky tasks; underlying-concepts before instructions; reference-details near values; decision-history near rationale; escalation thresholds; "you may be looking for…" where wrong turns appear; redirects and banners for obsolete terms.

## 4. Make files findable by search

Put exact grep terms in titles, aliases, and metadata (validated); for a wrong term, add disambiguation or a scoped alias only where it maps reliably; define and alias acronyms; link error and log strings to troubleshooting; use dashboard labels as aliases; map customer and old names where equivalent. A zero-hit `git grep` is a vocabulary gap — add an alias or a page.

## 5. Wire cross-references

Concept → tasks; task → prerequisite concepts and reference; reference → examples; troubleshooting → normal-operation docs; runbook → escalation; decision record → implementation; deprecated → replacement. Make each page help the reader continue; expose relationship context for retrieval; a mesh `why` carries a cross-file relationship one chunk cannot show.

## 6. Apply progressive disclosure

Put the highest-intent answer first; hide detail in expandable or linked sections; link rather than duplicate when ownership or freshness differs; move beginner-overwhelming detail below the basic path; promote expert detail into reference or quick links; separate quick-fix from deep-explanation; lead with summaries, diagrams, or examples; keep safety, prerequisite, and applicability detail visible before action.
