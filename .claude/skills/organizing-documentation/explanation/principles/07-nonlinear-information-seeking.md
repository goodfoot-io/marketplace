# Principle 7 — Nonlinear information seeking

Scope: why the corpus must serve readers who grep, jump, blame, and retrieve — never read top-to-bottom. Explanation mode.

Readers move nonlinearly: they search, skim, collect partial answers, reformulate, follow links, backtrack, and arrive from external systems or via an agent. Every page may be a reader's first page, so the corpus must support these journeys without abandoning source-of-truth structure.

## In a repo

No one reads a repository linearly. Every file and directory must self-orient on arrival; `git blame` and `git log -L` berrypick a region's history; a mesh `why` supplies the cross-file relationship an agent cannot infer from one chunk (`../foundations.md` §3). The concerns: **journeys**, **berrypicking**, **recovery** from wrong turns, **search behavior** (grep and retrieval), **cross-reference**, and **progressive disclosure**.

- Berrypick history: `../../reference/tools/git-history.md`.

Related: agents are first-class readers `../foundations.md`; the link kinds this needs `04-multiple-paths.md`; scent for skimmers `06-information-scent.md`.
