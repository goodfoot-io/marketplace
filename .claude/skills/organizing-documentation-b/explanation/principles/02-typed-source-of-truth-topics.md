# Principle 2 — Typed, source-of-truth topics

Scope: why each topic should be a typed, single-owner authority, separated by mode and type. Explanation mode.

A page that mixes documentation modes optimizes for none and rots unevenly; facts duplicated across pages drift apart. Type each topic and give it one owner so readers trust it and maintainers can keep it honest.

## In a repo

Code and config own behavior; the layered source of truth assigns every other fact an owner (`../foundations.md` §1). The concerns: **topic identity** (what deserves its own page versus a section), **documentation mode and page genre**, the four **topic types** (concept, task, reference, troubleshooting — plus glossary), and **canonicality** (resolving competing pages to one owner). Separate why from how structurally; record decision history in commits/PRs/ADRs; record a load-bearing unenforced coupling as a mesh.

## Apply / draws on

- Apply it: `../../how-to/type-a-topic.md`.
- Catalogs: page genres `../../reference/page-genres.md`; topic-type structures `../../reference/topic-types.md`.
