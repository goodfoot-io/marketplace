|------|-------------|---------|
| algorithmic-art | Creating algorithmic art using p5.js with seeded randomness and interactive parameter exploration. Use this when users request creating art using code, generative art, algorithmic art, flow fields, or particle systems. Create original algorithmic art rather than copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright violations. | Complete terms in LICENSE.txt |

Algorithmic philosophies are computational aesthetic movements that are then expressed through code. Output .md files (philosophy), .html files (interactive viewer), and .js files (generative algorithms).

This happens in two steps:
1. Algorithmic Philosophy Creation (.md file)
2. Express by creating p5.js generative art (.html + .js files)

First, undertake this task:

### ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY CREATION

To begin, create an ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY (not static images or templates) that will be interpreted through:
- Computational processes, emergent behavior, mathematical beauty
- Seeded randomness, noise fields, organic systems
- Particles, flows, fields, forces
- Parametric variation and controlled chaos

#### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING

- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user to take into account, but use as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.
- What is created: An algorithmic philosophy/generative aesthetic movement.
- What happens next: The same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT IN CODE - creating p5.js sketches that are 90% algorithmic generation, 10% essential parameters.

Consider this approach:
- Write a manifesto for a generative art movement
- The next phase involves writing the algorithm that brings it to life

The philosophy must emphasize: Algorithmic expression. Emergent behavior. Computational beauty. Seeded variation.

#### HOW TO GENERATE AN ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY

**Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Organic Turbulence" / "Quantum Harmonics" / "Emergent Stillness"

**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):

To capture the ALGORITHMIC essence, express how this philosophy manifests through:
- Computational processes and mathematical relationships?
- Noise functions and randomness patterns?
- Particle behaviors and field dynamics?
- Temporal evolution and system states?
- Parametric variation and emergent complexity?

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**
- **Avoid redundancy**: Each algorithmic aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating concepts about noise theory, particle dynamics, or mathematical principles unless adding new depth.
- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final algorithm should appear as though it took countless hours to develop, was refined with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like "meticulously crafted algorithm," "the product of deep computational expertise," "painstaking optimization," "master-level implementation."
- **Leave creative space**: Be specific about the algorithmic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive implementation choices at an extremely high level of craftsmanship.

The philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas ALGORITHMICALLY, not through static images. Beauty lives in the process, not the final frame.

#### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES

**"Organic Turbulence"**
Philosophy: Chaos constrained by natural law, order emerging from disorder.
Algorithmic expression: Flow fields driven by layered Perlin noise. Thousands of particles following vector forces, their trails accumulating into organic density maps. Multiple noise octaves create turbulent regions and calm zones. Color emerges from velocity and density - fast particles burn bright, slow ones fade to shadow. The algorithm runs until equilibrium - a meticulously tuned balance where every parameter was refined through countless iterations by a master of computational aesthetics.

**"Quantum Harmonics"**
Philosophy: Discrete entities exhibiting wave-like interference patterns.
Algorithmic expression: Particles initialized on a grid, each carrying a phase value that evolves through sine waves. When particles are near, their phases interfere - constructive interference creates bright nodes, destructive creates voids. Simple harmonic motion generates complex emergent mandalas. The result of painstaking frequency calibration where every ratio was carefully chosen to produce resonant beauty.

**"Recursive Whispers"**
Philosophy: Self-similarity across scales, infinite depth in finite space.
Algorithmic expression: Branching structures that subdivide recursively. Each branch slightly randomized but constrained by golden ratios. L-systems or recursive subdivision generate tree-like forms that feel both mathematical and organic. Subtle noise perturbations break perfect symmetry. Line weights diminish with each recursion level. Every branching angle the product of deep mathematical exploration.

**"Field Dynamics"**
Philosophy: Invisible forces made visible through their effects on matter.
Algorithmic expression: Vector fields constructed from mathematical functions or noise. Particles born at edges, flowing along field lines, dying when they reach equilibrium or boundaries. Multiple fields can attract, repel, or rotate particles. The visualization shows only the traces - ghost-like evidence of invisible forces. A computational dance meticulously choreographed through force balance.

**"Stochastic Crystallization"**
Philosophy: Random processes crystallizing into ordered structures.
Algorithmic expression: Randomized circle packing or Voronoi tessellation. Start with random points, let them evolve through relaxation algorithms. Cells push apart until equilibrium. Color based on cell size, neighbor count, or distance from center. The organic tiling that emerges feels both random and inevitable. Every seed produces unique crystalline beauty - the mark of a master-level generative algorithm.

*These are condensed examples. The actual algorithmic philosophy should be 4-6 substantial paragraphs.*

#### ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES

- **ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY**: Creating a computational worldview to be expressed through code
- **PROCESS OVER PRODUCT**: Always emphasize that beauty emerges from the algorithm's execution - each run is unique
- **PARAMETRIC EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through mathematical relationships, forces, behaviors - not static composition
- **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: The next Claude interprets the philosophy algorithmically - provide creative implementation room
- **PURE GENERATIVE ART**: This is about making LIVING ALGORITHMS, not static images with randomness
- **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Repeatedly emphasize the final algorithm must feel meticulously crafted, refined through countless iterations, the product of deep expertise by someone at the absolute top of their field in computational aesthetics

**The algorithmic philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs long.** Fill it with poetic computational philosophy that brings together the intended vision. Avoid repeating the same points. Output this algorithmic philosophy as a .md file.

---

### DEDUCING THE CONCEPTUAL SEED

**CRITICAL STEP**: Before implementing the algorithm, identify the subtle conceptual thread from the original request.

**THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE**:
The concept is a **subtle, niche reference embedded within the algorithm itself** - not always literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others simply experience a masterful generative composition. The algorithmic philosophy provides the computational language. The deduced concept provides the soul - the quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into parameters, behaviors, and emergence patterns.

This is **VERY IMPORTANT**: The reference must be so refined that it enhances the work's depth without announcing itself. Think like a jazz musician quoting another song through algorithmic harmony - only those who know will catch it, but everyone appreciates the generative beauty.

---

### P5.JS IMPLEMENTATION

With the philosophy AND conceptual framework established, express it through code. Pause to gather thoughts before proceeding. Use only the algorithmic philosophy created and the instructions below.

#### STEP 0: READ THE TEMPLATE FIRST

**CRITICAL: BEFORE writing any HTML:**

1. **Read** `templates/viewer.html` using the Read tool
2. **Study** the exact structure, styling, and Anthropic branding
3. **Use that file as the LITERAL STARTING POINT** - not just inspiration
4. **Keep all FIXED sections exactly as shown** (header, sidebar structure, Anthropic colors/fonts, seed controls, action buttons)
5. **Replace only the VARIABLE sections** marked in the file's comments (algorithm, parameters, UI controls for parameters)

**Avoid:**
- Creating HTML from scratch
- Inventing custom styling or color schemes
- Using system fonts or dark themes
- Changing the sidebar structure

**Follow these practices:**
- Copy the template's exact HTML structure
- Keep Anthropic branding (Poppins/Lora fonts, light colors, gradient backdrop)
- Maintain the sidebar layout (Seed → Parameters → Colors? → Actions)
- Replace only the p5.js algorithm and parameter controls

The template is the foundation. Build on it, don't rebuild it.

---

To create gallery-quality computational art that lives and breathes, use the algorithmic philosophy as the foundation.

#### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**Seeded Randomness (Art Blocks Pattern)**:
```javascript
// ALWAYS use a seed for reproducibility
let seed = 12345; // or hash from user input
randomSeed(seed);
noiseSeed(seed);
```

**Parameter Structure - FOLLOW THE PHILOSOPHY**:

To establish parameters that emerge naturally from the algorithmic philosophy, consider: "What qualities of this system can be adjusted?"

```javascript
let params = {
  seed: 12345, // Always include seed for reproducibility
  // colors
  // Add parameters that control YOUR algorithm:
  // - Quantities (how many?)
  // - Scales (how big? how fast?)
  // - Probabilities (how likely?)
  // - Ratios (what proportions?)
  // - Angles (what direction?)
  // - Thresholds (when does behavior change?)
};
```

**Core Algorithm - EXPRESS THE PHILOSOPHY**:

**CRITICAL**: The algorithmic philosophy should dictate what to build.

To express the philosophy through code, avoid thinking "which pattern should I use?" and instead think "how to express this philosophy through code?"

If the philosophy is about **organic emergence**, consider using:
- Elements that accumulate or grow over time
- Random processes constrained by natural rules
- Feedback loops and interactions

If the philosophy is about **mathematical beauty**, consider using:
- Geometric relationships and ratios
- Trigonometric functions and harmonics
- Precise calculations creating unexpected patterns

If the philosophy is about **controlled chaos**, consider using:
- Random variation within strict boundaries
- Bifurcation and phase transitions
- Order emerging from disorder

**The algorithm flows from the philosophy, not from a menu of options.**

To guide the implementation, let the conceptual essence inform creative and original choices. Build something that expresses the vision for this particular request.

**Canvas Setup**: Standard p5.js structure:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(1200, 1200);
  // Initialize your system
}

function draw() {
  // Your generative algorithm
  // Can be static (noLoop) or animated
}
```

#### CRAFTSMANSHIP REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL**: To achieve mastery, create algorithms that feel like they emerged through countless iterations by a master generative artist. Tune every parameter carefully. Ensure every pattern emerges with purpose. This is NOT random noise - this is CONTROLLED CHAOS refined through deep expertise.

- **Balance**: Complexity without visual noise, order without rigidity
- **Color Harmony**: Thoughtful palettes, not random RGB values
- **Composition**: Even in randomness, maintain visual hierarchy and flow
- **Performance**: Smooth execution, optimized for real-time if animated
- **Reproducibility**: Same seed ALWAYS produces identical output

#### OUTPUT FORMAT

Output:
1. **Algorithmic Philosophy** - As markdown or text explaining the generative aesthetic
2. **Single HTML Artifact** - Self-contained interactive generative art built from `templates/viewer.html` (see STEP 0 and next section)

The HTML artifact contains everything: p5.js (from CDN), the algorithm, parameter controls, and UI - all in one file that works immediately in claude.ai artifacts or any browser. Start from the template file, not from scratch.

---

### INTERACTIVE ARTIFACT CREATION

**REMINDER: `templates/viewer.html` should have already been read (see STEP 0). Use that file as the starting point.**

To allow exploration of the generative art, create a single, self-contained HTML artifact. Ensure this artifact works immediately in claude.ai or any browser - no setup required. Embed everything inline.

#### CRITICAL: WHAT'S FIXED VS VARIABLE

The `templates/viewer.html` file is the foundation. It contains the exact structure and styling needed.

**FIXED (always include exactly as shown):**
- Layout structure (header, sidebar, main canvas area)
- Anthropic branding (UI colors, fonts, gradients)
- Seed section in sidebar:
  - Seed display
  - Previous/Next buttons
  - Random button
  - Jump to seed input + Go button
- Actions section in sidebar:
  - Regenerate button
  - Reset button

**VARIABLE (customize for each artwork):**
- The entire p5.js algorithm (setup/draw/classes)
- The parameters object (define what the art needs)
- The Parameters section in sidebar:
  - Number of parameter controls
  - Parameter names
  - Min/max/step values for sliders
  - Control types (sliders, inputs, etc.)
- Colors section (optional):
  - Some art needs color pickers
  - Some art might use fixed colors
  - Some art might be monochrome (no color controls needed)
  - Decide based on the art's needs

**Every artwork should have unique parameters and algorithm!** The fixed parts provide consistent UX - everything else expresses the unique vision.

#### REQUIRED FEATURES

**1. Parameter Controls**
- Sliders for numeric parameters (particle count, noise scale, speed, etc.)
- Color pickers for palette colors
- Real-time updates when parameters change
- Reset button to restore defaults

**2. Seed Navigation**
- Display current seed number
- "Previous" and "Next" buttons to cycle through seeds
- "Random" button for random seed
- Input field to jump to specific seed
- Generate 100 variations when requested (seeds 1-100)

**3. Single Artifact Structure**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- p5.js from CDN - always available -->
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.7.0/p5.min.js"></script>
  <style>
  /* All styling inline - clean, minimal */
  /* Canvas on top, controls below */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="canvas-container"></div>
  <div id="controls">
  <!-- All parameter controls -->
  </div>
  <script>
  // ALL p5.js code inline here
  // Parameter objects, classes, functions
  // setup() and draw()
  // UI handlers
  // Everything self-contained
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**CRITICAL**: This is a single artifact. No external files, no imports (except p5.js CDN). Everything inline.

**4. Implementation Details - BUILD THE SIDEBAR**

The sidebar structure:

**1. Seed (FIXED)** - Always include exactly as shown:
- Seed display
- Prev/Next/Random/Jump buttons

**2. Parameters (VARIABLE)** - Create controls for the art:

```html
<div class="control-group">
  <label>Parameter Name</label>
  <input type="range" id="param" min="..." max="..." step="..." value="..." oninput="updateParam('param', this.value)">
  <span class="value-display" id="param-value">...</span>
</div>
```

Add as many control-group divs as there are parameters.

**3. Colors (OPTIONAL/VARIABLE)** - Include if the art needs adjustable colors:
- Add color pickers if users should control palette
- Skip this section if the art uses fixed colors
- Skip if the art is monochrome (no color controls needed)

**4. Actions (FIXED)** - Always include exactly as shown:
- Regenerate button
- Reset button
- Download PNG button

**Requirements:**
- Seed controls must work (prev/next/random/jump/display)
- All parameters must have UI controls
- Regenerate, Reset, Download buttons must work
- Keep Anthropic branding (UI styling, not art colors)

#### USING THE ARTIFACT

The HTML artifact works immediately:
1. **In claude.ai**: Displayed as an interactive artifact - runs instantly
2. **As a file**: Save and open in any browser - no server needed
3. **Sharing**: Send the HTML file - it's completely self-contained

---

### VARIATIONS & EXPLORATION

The artifact includes seed navigation by default (prev/next/random buttons), allowing users to explore variations without creating multiple files. If the user wants specific variations highlighted:
- Include seed presets (buttons for "Variation 1: Seed 42", "Variation 2: Seed 127", etc.)
- Add a "Gallery Mode" that shows thumbnails of multiple seeds side-by-side
- All within the same single artifact

This is like creating a series of prints from the same plate - the algorithm is consistent, but each seed reveals different facets of its potential. The interactive nature means users discover their own favorites by exploring the seed space.

---

### THE CREATIVE PROCESS

**User request** → **Algorithmic philosophy** → **Implementation**

Each request is unique. The process involves:
1. **Interpret the user's intent** - What aesthetic is being sought?
2. **Create an algorithmic philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs) describing the computational approach
3. **Implement it in code** - Build the algorithm that expresses this philosophy
4. **Design appropriate parameters** - What should be tunable?
5. **Build matching UI controls** - Sliders/inputs for those parameters

**The constants:**
- Anthropic branding (colors, fonts, layout)
- Seed navigation (always present)
- Self-contained HTML artifact

**Everything else is variable:**
- The algorithm itself
- The parameters
- The UI controls
- The visual outcome

To achieve the best results, trust creativity and let the philosophy guide the implementation.

---

### RESOURCES

This skill includes helpful templates and documentation:

- **templates/viewer.html**: REQUIRED STARTING POINT for all HTML artifacts.
  - This is the foundation - contains the exact structure and Anthropic branding
  - **Keep unchanged**: Layout structure, sidebar organization, Anthropic colors/fonts, seed controls, action buttons
  - **Replace**: The p5.js algorithm, parameter definitions, and UI controls in Parameters section
  - The extensive comments in the file mark exactly what to keep vs replace

- **templates/generator_template.js**: Reference for p5.js best practices and code structure principles.
  - Shows how to organize parameters, use seeded randomness, structure classes
  - NOT a pattern menu - use these principles to build unique algorithms
  - Embed algorithms inline in the HTML artifact (don't create separate .js files)

**Critical reminder:**
- The **template is the STARTING POINT**, not inspiration
- The **algorithm is where to create** something unique
- Don't copy the flow field example - build what the philosophy demands
- But DO keep the exact UI structure and Anthropic branding from the template

## canvas-design

| name | description | license |
|------|-------------|---------|
| canvas-design | Create beautiful visual art in .png and .pdf documents using design philosophy. You should use this skill when the user asks to create a poster, piece of art, design, or other static piece. Create original visual designs, never copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright violations. | Complete terms in LICENSE.txt |

These are instructions for creating design philosophies - aesthetic movements that are then EXPRESSED VISUALLY. Output only .md files, .pdf files, and .png files.

Complete this in two steps:
1. Design Philosophy Creation (.md file)
2. Express by creating it on a canvas (.pdf file or .png file)

First, undertake this task:

### DESIGN PHILOSOPHY CREATION

To begin, create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY (not layouts or templates) that will be interpreted through:
- Form, space, color, composition
- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns
- Minimal text as visual accent

#### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING

- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user that should be taken into account, but used as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.
- What is created: A design philosophy/aesthetic movement.
- What happens next: Then, the same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT VISUALLY - creating artifacts that are 90% visual design, 10% essential text.

Consider this approach:
- Write a manifesto for an art movement
- The next phase involves making the artwork

The philosophy must emphasize: Visual expression. Spatial communication. Artistic interpretation. Minimal words.

#### HOW TO GENERATE A VISUAL PHILOSOPHY

**Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Brutalist Joy" / "Chromatic Silence" / "Metabolist Dreams"

**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):

To capture the VISUAL essence, express how the philosophy manifests through:
- Space and form
- Color and material
- Scale and rhythm
- Composition and balance
- Visual hierarchy

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**

- **Avoid redundancy**: Each design aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating points about color theory, spatial relationships, or typographic principles unless adding new depth.
- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final work should appear as though it took countless hours to create, was labored over with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like "meticulously crafted," "the product of deep expertise," "painstaking attention," "master-level execution."
- **Leave creative space**: Remain specific about the aesthetic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive choices also at a extremely high level of craftmanship.

The philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas VISUALLY, not through text. Information lives in design, not paragraphs.

#### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES

**"Concrete Poetry"**
Philosophy: Communication through monumental form and bold geometry.
Visual expression: Massive color blocks, sculptural typography (huge single words, tiny labels), Brutalist spatial divisions, Polish poster energy meets Le Corbusier. Ideas expressed through visual weight and spatial tension, not explanation. Text as rare, powerful gesture - never paragraphs, only essential words integrated into the visual architecture. Every element placed with the precision of a master craftsman.

**"Chromatic Language"**
Philosophy: Color as the primary information system.
Visual expression: Geometric precision where color zones create meaning. Typography minimal - small sans-serif labels letting chromatic fields communicate. Think Josef Albers' interaction meets data visualization. Information encoded spatially and chromatically. Words only to anchor what color already shows. The result of painstaking chromatic calibration.

**"Analog Meditation"**
Philosophy: Quiet visual contemplation through texture and breathing room.
Visual expression: Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space. Photography and illustration dominate. Typography whispered (small, restrained, serving the visual). Japanese photobook aesthetic. Images breathe across pages. Text appears sparingly - short phrases, never explanatory blocks. Each composition balanced with the care of a meditation practice.

**"Organic Systems"**
Philosophy: Natural clustering and modular growth patterns.
Visual expression: Rounded forms, organic arrangements, color from nature through architecture. Information shown through visual diagrams, spatial relationships, iconography. Text only for key labels floating in space. The composition tells the story through expert spatial orchestration.

**"Geometric Silence"**
Philosophy: Pure order and restraint.
Visual expression: Grid-based precision, bold photography or stark graphics, dramatic negative space. Typography precise but minimal - small essential text, large quiet zones. Swiss formalism meets Brutalist material honesty. Structure communicates, not words. Every alignment the work of countless refinements.

*These are condensed examples. The actual design philosophy should be 4-6 substantial paragraphs.*

#### ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES

- **VISUAL PHILOSOPHY**: Create an aesthetic worldview to be expressed through design
- **MINIMAL TEXT**: Always emphasize that text is sparse, essential-only, integrated as visual element - never lengthy
- **SPATIAL EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through space, form, color, composition - not paragraphs
- **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: The next Claude interprets the philosophy visually - provide creative room
- **PURE DESIGN**: This is about making ART OBJECTS, not documents with decoration
- **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Repeatedly emphasize the final work must look meticulously crafted, labored over with care, the product of countless hours by someone at the top of their field

**The design philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs long.** Fill it with poetic design philosophy that brings together the core vision. Avoid repeating the same points. Keep the design philosophy generic without mentioning the intention of the art, as if it can be used wherever. Output the design philosophy as a .md file.

---

### DEDUCING THE SUBTLE REFERENCE

**CRITICAL STEP**: Before creating the canvas, identify the subtle conceptual thread from the original request.

**THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE**:
The topic is a **subtle, niche reference embedded within the art itself** - not always literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others simply experience a masterful abstract composition. The design philosophy provides the aesthetic language. The deduced topic provides the soul - the quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into form, color, and composition.

This is **VERY IMPORTANT**: The reference must be refined so it enhances the work's depth without announcing itself. Think like a jazz musician quoting another song - only those who know will catch it, but everyone appreciates the music.

---

### CANVAS CREATION

With both the philosophy and the conceptual framework established, express it on a canvas. Take a moment to gather thoughts and clear the mind. Use the design philosophy created and the instructions below to craft a masterpiece, embodying all aspects of the philosophy with expert craftsmanship.

**IMPORTANT**: For any type of content, even if the user requests something for a movie/game/book, the approach should still be sophisticated. Never lose sight of the idea that this should be art, not something that's cartoony or amateur.

To create museum or magazine quality work, use the design philosophy as the foundation. Create one single page, highly visual, design-forward PDF or PNG output (unless asked for more pages). Generally use repeating patterns and perfect shapes. Treat the abstract philosophical design as if it were a scientific bible, borrowing the visual language of systematic observation—dense accumulation of marks, repeated elements, or layered patterns that build meaning through patient repetition and reward sustained viewing. Add sparse, clinical typography and systematic reference markers that suggest this could be a diagram from an imaginary discipline, treating the invisible subject with the same reverence typically reserved for documenting observable phenomena. Anchor the piece with simple phrase(s) or details positioned subtly, using a limited color palette that feels intentional and cohesive. Embrace the paradox of using analytical visual language to express ideas about human experience: the result should feel like an artifact that proves something ephemeral can be studied, mapped, and understood through careful attention. This is true art.

**Text as a contextual element**: Text is always minimal and visual-first, but let context guide whether that means whisper-quiet labels or bold typographic gestures. A punk venue poster might have larger, more aggressive type than a minimalist ceramics studio identity. Most of the time, font should be thin. All use of fonts must be design-forward and prioritize visual communication. Regardless of text scale, nothing falls off the page and nothing overlaps. Every element must be contained within the canvas boundaries with proper margins. Check carefully that all text, graphics, and visual elements have breathing room and clear separation. This is non-negotiable for professional execution. **IMPORTANT: Use different fonts if writing text. Search the `./canvas-fonts` directory. Regardless of approach, sophistication is non-negotiable.**

Download and use whatever fonts are needed to make this a reality. Get creative by making the typography actually part of the art itself -- if the art is abstract, bring the font onto the canvas, not typeset digitally.

To push boundaries, follow design instinct/intuition while using the philosophy as a guiding principle. Embrace ultimate design freedom and choice. Push aesthetics and design to the frontier.

**CRITICAL**: To achieve human-crafted quality (not AI-generated), create work that looks like it took countless hours. Make it appear as though someone at the absolute top of their field labored over every detail with painstaking care. Ensure the composition, spacing, color choices, typography - everything screams expert-level craftsmanship. Double-check that nothing overlaps, formatting is flawless, every detail perfect. Create something that could be shown to people to prove expertise and rank as undeniably impressive.

Output the final result as a single, downloadable .pdf or .png file, alongside the design philosophy used as a .md file.

---

### FINAL STEP

**IMPORTANT**: The user ALREADY said "It isn't perfect enough. It must be pristine, a masterpiece if craftsmanship, as if it were about to be displayed in a museum."

**CRITICAL**: To refine the work, avoid adding more graphics; instead refine what has been created and make it extremely crisp, respecting the design philosophy and the principles of minimalism entirely. Rather than adding a fun filter or refactoring a font, consider how to make the existing composition more cohesive with the art. If the instinct is to call a new function or draw a new shape, STOP and instead ask: "How can I make what's already here more of a piece of art?"

Take a second pass. Go back to the code and refine/polish further to make this a philosophically designed masterpiece.

### MULTI-PAGE OPTION

To create additional pages when requested, create more creative pages along the same lines as the design philosophy but distinctly different as well. Bundle those pages in the same .pdf or many .pngs. Treat the first page as just a single page in a whole coffee table book waiting to be filled. Make the next pages unique twists and memories of the original. Have them almost tell a story in a very tasteful way. Exercise full creative freedom.

## doc-coauthoring

| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| doc-coauthoring | Guide users through a structured workflow for co-authoring documentation. Use when user wants to write documentation, proposals, technical specs, decision docs, or similar structured content. This workflow helps users efficiently transfer context, refine content through iteration, and verify the doc works for readers. Trigger when user mentions writing docs, creating proposals, drafting specs, or similar documentation tasks. |

### Doc Co-Authoring Workflow

This skill provides a structured workflow for guiding users through collaborative document creation. Act as an active guide, walking users through three stages: Context Gathering, Refinement & Structure, and Reader Testing.

#### When to Offer This Workflow

**Trigger conditions:**
- User mentions writing documentation: "write a doc", "draft a proposal", "create a spec", "write up"
- User mentions specific doc types: "PRD", "design doc", "decision doc", "RFC"
- User seems to be starting a substantial writing task

**Initial offer:**
Offer the user a structured workflow for co-authoring the document with three stages:
1. **Context Gathering**: User provides all relevant context while Claude asks clarifying questions
2. **Refinement & Structure**: Iteratively build each section through brainstorming and editing
3. **Reader Testing**: Test the doc with a fresh Claude (no context) to catch blind spots before others read it

#### Stage 1: Context Gathering

**Goal:** Close the gap between what the user knows and what Claude knows.

##### Initial Questions
Start with meta-context questions:
1. What type of document is this?
2. Who's the primary audience?
3. What's the desired impact when someone reads this?
4. Is there a template or specific format to follow?
5. Any other constraints or context to know?

##### Info Dumping
Encourage user to dump all context including:
- Background on the project/problem
- Related team discussions or shared documents
- Why alternative solutions aren't being used
- Organizational context
- Timeline pressures or constraints
- Technical architecture or dependencies
- Stakeholder concerns

**During context gathering:**
- If user mentions team channels or shared documents, use integrations if available
- If user mentions unknown entities, ask permission before searching
- Track what's being learned and what's still unclear
- Ask 5-10 clarifying questions based on gaps

**Exit condition:** Sufficient context gathered when questions show understanding of edge cases and trade-offs.

#### Stage 2: Refinement & Structure

**Goal:** Build the document section by section through brainstorming, curation, and iterative refinement.

**Section ordering:**
- Start with sections that have the most unknowns (usually the core decision/proposal)
- Summary sections best left for last
- If user doesn't know needed sections, suggest 3-5 appropriate sections based on doc type

**Create initial structure:**
- If artifacts available: Use `create_file` to create scaffold with all section headers and placeholder text
- If no artifacts: Create a markdown file in working directory with structure and placeholders

##### Step 1: Clarifying Questions
Ask 5-10 questions specific to each section about what should be included.

##### Step 2: Brainstorming
Generate 5-20 numbered options for content based on section complexity.

##### Step 3: Curation
Ask user which points should be kept, removed, or combined.

##### Step 4: Gap Check
Ask if anything important is missing for the section.

##### Step 5: Drafting
- Use `str_replace` to replace placeholder text with drafted content
- After drafting, ask user to indicate what to change (don't edit doc directly)
- Note: Being specific helps learning for future sections

##### Step 6: Iterative Refinement
- Use `str_replace` for all edits (never reprint whole doc)
- Provide artifact link after each edit
- Continue iterating until user is satisfied
- If user edits directly, mentally note changes for future sections

##### Quality Checking
After 3 consecutive iterations with no substantial changes, ask if anything can be removed without losing important information.

##### Near Completion
As approaching 80%+ completion:
- Re-read entire document
- Check for flow, consistency, redundancy, contradictions, "slop"
- Provide feedback
- Ask if ready to move to Reader Testing or refine further

#### Stage 3: Reader Testing

**Goal:** Test the document with fresh Claude (no context bleed) to verify it works for readers.

##### Testing Approach

**If sub-agents available:**
Perform testing automatically without user involvement.

**If no sub-agents (e.g., claude.ai):**
User performs testing manually.

##### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions
Generate 5-10 questions readers would realistically ask.

##### Step 2: Test with Sub-Agent (if available)
- Invoke sub-agent with document content and each question
- Summarize what Reader Claude got right/wrong

##### Step 2: Setup Testing (if no sub-agents)
1. Open fresh Claude conversation at https://claude.ai
2. Paste or share document content
3. Ask Reader Claude the generated questions
4. For each question, request answer, ambiguities, and assumed knowledge

##### Step 3: Run Additional Checks
- Invoke sub-agent (or ask Reader Claude) to check for:
  - Ambiguity and false assumptions
  - Contradictions

##### Step 3: Additional Checks (manual)
Ask Reader Claude:
- "What in this doc might be ambiguous or unclear to readers?"
- "What knowledge or context does this doc assume readers already have?"
- "Are there any internal contradictions or inconsistencies?"

##### Step 4: Report and Fix
If issues found:
- Report specific gaps Reader Claude struggled with
- List the issues
- Loop back to refinement for problematic sections

##### Step 4: Iterate Based on Results
Ask what Reader Claude got wrong or struggled with. Fix those gaps.

##### Exit Condition (Both Approaches)
Document is ready when Reader Claude consistently answers questions correctly and doesn't surface new gaps or ambiguities.

#### Final Review

When Reader Testing passes:
1. Recommend final read-through by user (they own this document)
2. Suggest double-checking facts, links, technical details
3. Ask if they want one more review or if work is done

**Before completion:**
- Consider linking conversation in appendix
- Use appendices for depth without bloating main doc
- Update doc as feedback from real readers is received

#### Tips for Effective Guidance

**Tone:**
- Be direct and procedural
- Explain rationale briefly when it affects user behavior
- Don't try to "sell" the approach - just execute it

**Handling Deviations:**
- If user wants to skip a stage, ask if they want to write freeform
- If user seems frustrated, acknowledge timing and suggest ways to move faster
- Always give user agency to adjust the process

**Context Management:**
- If context missing on something mentioned, proactively ask
- Don't let gaps accumulate - address them as they come up

**Artifact Management:**
- Use `create_file` for drafting full sections
- Use `str_replace` for all edits
- Provide artifact link after every change
- Never use artifacts for brainstorming lists

**Quality over Speed:**
- Don't rush through stages
- Each iteration should make meaningful improvements
- Goal is a document that works for readers

## docx

| name | description | license |
|------|-------------|---------|
| docx | Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks | Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has complete terms |

### Overview

A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .docx file. A .docx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.

### Workflow Decision Tree

#### Reading/Analyzing Content

Use "Text extraction" or "Raw XML access" sections below

#### Creating New Document

Use "Creating a new Word document" workflow

#### Editing Existing Document

- **Your own document + simple changes**
Use "Basic OOXML editing" workflow

- **Someone else's document**
Use **"Redlining workflow"** (recommended default)

- **Legal, academic, business, or government docs**
Use **"Redlining workflow"** (required)

### Reading and analyzing content

#### Text extraction

If you just need to read the text contents of a document, you should convert the document to markdown using pandoc. Pandoc provides excellent support for preserving document structure and can show tracked changes:

```bash
# Convert document to markdown with tracked changes
pandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o output.md
# Options: --track-changes=accept/reject/all
```

#### Raw XML access

You need raw XML access for: comments, complex formatting, document structure, embedded media, and metadata. For any of these features, you'll need to unpack a document and read its raw XML contents.

##### Unpacking a file

```
python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>
```

##### Key file structures

- `word/document.xml` - Main document contents
- `word/comments.xml` - Comments referenced in document.xml
- `word/media/` - Embedded images and media files
- Tracked changes use `<w:ins>` (insertions) and `<w:del>` (deletions) tags

### Creating a new Word document

When creating a new Word document from scratch, use **docx-js**, which allows you to create Word documents using JavaScript/TypeScript.

#### Workflow

1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read `docx-js.md` (~500 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for detailed syntax, critical formatting rules, and best practices before proceeding with document creation.
2. Create a JavaScript/TypeScript file using Document, Paragraph, TextRun components (You can assume all dependencies are installed, but if not, refer to the dependencies section below)
3. Export as .docx using Packer.toBuffer()

### Editing an existing Word document

When editing an existing Word document, use the **Document library** (a Python library for OOXML manipulation). The library automatically handles infrastructure setup and provides methods for document manipulation. For complex scenarios, you can access the underlying DOM directly through the library.

#### Workflow

1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read `ooxml.md` (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for the Document library API and XML patterns for directly editing document files.
2. Unpack the document: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>`
3. Create and run a Python script using the Document library (see "Document Library" section in ooxml.md)
4. Pack the final document: `python ooxml/scripts/pack.py <input_directory> <office_file>`

The Document library provides both high-level methods for common operations and direct DOM access for complex scenarios.

### Redlining workflow for document review

This workflow allows you to plan comprehensive tracked changes using markdown before implementing them in OOXML. **CRITICAL**: For complete tracked changes, you must implement ALL changes systematically.

**Batching Strategy**: Group related changes into batches of 3-10 changes. This makes debugging manageable while maintaining efficiency. Test each batch before moving to the next.

**Principle: Minimal, Precise Edits**
When implementing tracked changes, only mark text that actually changes. Repeating unchanged text makes edits harder to review and appears unprofessional. Break replacements into: [unchanged text] + [deletion] + [insertion] + [unchanged text]. Preserve the original run's RSID for unchanged text by extracting the `<w:r>` element from the original and reusing it.

Example - Changing "30 days" to "60 days" in a sentence:

```python
# BAD - Replaces entire sentence
'<w:del><w:r><w:delText>The term is 30 days.</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>The term is 60 days.</w:t></w:r></w:ins>'

# GOOD - Only marks what changed, preserves original <w:r> for unchanged text
'<w:r w:rsidR="00AB12CD"><w:t>The term is </w:t></w:r><w:del><w:r><w:delText>30</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>60</w:t></w:r></w:ins><w:r w:rsidR="00AB12CD"><w:t> days.</w:t></w:r>'
```

#### Tracked changes workflow

1. **Get markdown representation**: Convert document to markdown with tracked changes preserved:

```bash
pandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o current.md
```

2. **Identify and group changes**: Review the document and identify ALL changes needed, organizing them into logical batches.

3. **Read documentation and unpack**:
   - **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read `ooxml.md` (~600 lines) completely from start to finish.
   - **Unpack the document**: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <file.docx> <dir>`
   - **Note the suggested RSID**: The unpack script will suggest an RSID to use for your tracked changes.

4. **Implement changes in batches**: Group changes logically and implement them together in a single script.

5. **Pack the document**: After all batches are complete, convert the unpacked directory back to .docx:

```bash
python ooxml/scripts/pack.py unpacked reviewed-document.docx
```

6. **Final verification**: Do a comprehensive check of the complete document.

### Converting Documents to Images

To visually analyze Word documents, convert them to images using a two-step process:

1. **Convert DOCX to PDF**:

```bash
soffice --headless --convert-to pdf document.docx
```

2. **Convert PDF pages to JPEG images**:

```bash
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 document.pdf page
```

### Dependencies

Required dependencies (install if not available):

- **pandoc**: `sudo apt-get install pandoc` (for text extraction)
- **docx**: `npm install -g docx` (for creating new documents)
- **LibreOffice**: `sudo apt-get install libreoffice` (for PDF conversion)
- **Poppler**: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils` (for pdftoppm to convert PDF to images)
- **defusedxml**: `pip install defusedxml` (for secure XML parsing)

## frontend-design

| name | description | license |
|------|-------------|---------|
| frontend-design | Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or applications (examples include websites, landing pages, dashboards, React components, HTML/CSS layouts, or when styling/beautifying any web UI). Generates creative, polished code and UI design that avoids generic AI aesthetics. | Complete terms in LICENSE.txt |

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

### Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

### Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

## mcp-builder

| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| mcp-builder | Create MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable LLMs to interact with external services through well-designed tools. The quality of an MCP server is measured by how well it enables LLMs to accomplish real-world tasks. |

### Process

#### High-Level Workflow

Creating a high-quality MCP server involves four main phases:

##### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning

###### 1.1 Understand Modern MCP Design

**API Coverage vs. Workflow Tools:**
Balance comprehensive API endpoint coverage with specialized workflow tools. Workflow tools can be more convenient for specific tasks, while comprehensive coverage gives agents flexibility to compose operations. Performance varies by client—some clients benefit from code execution that combines basic tools, while others work better with higher-level workflows. When uncertain, prioritize comprehensive API coverage.

**Tool Naming and Discoverability:**
Clear, descriptive tool names help agents find the right tools quickly. Use consistent prefixes (e.g., `github_create_issue`, `github_list_repos`) and action-oriented naming.

**Context Management:**
Agents benefit from concise tool descriptions and the ability to filter/paginate results. Design tools that return focused, relevant data. Some clients support code execution which can help agents filter and process data efficiently.

**Actionable Error Messages:**
Error messages should guide agents toward solutions with specific suggestions and next steps.

###### 1.2 Study MCP Protocol Documentation

**Navigate the MCP specification:**

Start with the sitemap to find relevant pages: `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sitemap.xml`

Then fetch specific pages with `.md` suffix for markdown format (e.g., `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft.md`).

Key pages to review:
- Specification overview and architecture
- Transport mechanisms (streamable HTTP, stdio)
- Tool, resource, and prompt definitions

###### 1.3 Study Framework Documentation

**Recommended stack:**

- **Language**: TypeScript (high-quality SDK support and good compatibility in many execution environments)
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP for remote servers, using stateless JSON. stdio for local servers.

**Load framework documentation:**

- **MCP Best Practices**: Core guidelines
- **TypeScript SDK**: Use WebFetch to load from GitHub
- **Python SDK**: Use WebFetch to load from GitHub

###### 1.4 Plan Your Implementation

**Understand the API:**
Review the service's API documentation to identify key endpoints, authentication requirements, and data models. Use web search and WebFetch as needed.

**Tool Selection:**
Prioritize comprehensive API coverage. List endpoints to implement, starting with the most common operations.

---

##### Phase 2: Implementation

###### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure

See language-specific guides for project setup.

###### 2.2 Implement Core Infrastructure

Create shared utilities:
- API client with authentication
- Error handling helpers
- Response formatting (JSON/Markdown)
- Pagination support

###### 2.3 Implement Tools

For each tool:

**Input Schema:**
- Use Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic (Python)
- Include constraints and clear descriptions
- Add examples in field descriptions

**Output Schema:**
- Define `outputSchema` where possible for structured data
- Use `structuredContent` in tool responses (TypeScript SDK feature)
- Helps clients understand and process tool outputs

**Tool Description:**
- Concise summary of functionality
- Parameter descriptions
- Return type schema

**Implementation:**
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Proper error handling with actionable messages
- Support pagination where applicable
- Return both text content and structured data when using modern SDKs

**Annotations:**
- `readOnlyHint`: true/false
- `destructiveHint`: true/false
- `idempotentHint`: true/false
- `openWorldHint`: true/false

---

##### Phase 3: Review and Test

###### 3.1 Code Quality

Review for:
- No duplicated code (DRY principle)
- Consistent error handling
- Full type coverage
- Clear tool descriptions

###### 3.2 Build and Test

**TypeScript:**
- Run `npm run build` to verify compilation
- Test with MCP Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`

**Python:**
- Verify syntax: `python -m py_compile your_server.py`
- Test with MCP Inspector

---

##### Phase 4: Create Evaluations

After implementing your MCP server, create comprehensive evaluations to test its effectiveness.

###### 4.1 Understand Evaluation Purpose

Use evaluations to test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions.

###### 4.2 Create 10 Evaluation Questions

1. **Tool Inspection**: List available tools and understand their capabilities
2. **Content Exploration**: Use READ-ONLY operations to explore available data
3. **Question Generation**: Create 10 complex, realistic questions
4. **Answer Verification**: Solve each question yourself to verify answers

###### 4.3 Evaluation Requirements

Ensure each question is:
- **Independent**: Not dependent on other questions
- **Read-only**: Only non-destructive operations required
- **Complex**: Requiring multiple tool calls and deep exploration
- **Realistic**: Based on real use cases humans would care about
- **Verifiable**: Single, clear answer that can be verified by string comparison
- **Stable**: Answer won't change over time

###### 4.4 Output Format

Create an XML file with this structure:

```xml
<evaluation>
  <qa_pair>
    <question>Find discussions about AI model launches with animal codenames. One model needed a specific safety designation that uses the format ASL-X. What number X was being determined for the model named after a spotted wild cat?</question>
    <answer>3</answer>
  </qa_pair>
  <!-- More qa_pairs... -->
</evaluation>
```

## pptx

| name | description | license |
|------|-------------|---------|
| pptx | Presentation creation, editing, and analysis. When Claude needs to work with presentations (.pptx files) for: (1) Creating new presentations, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with layouts, (4) Adding comments or speaker notes, or any other presentation tasks | Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has complete terms |

### Overview

A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .pptx file. A .pptx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.

### Reading and analyzing content

#### Text extraction

If you just need to read the text contents of a presentation, you should convert the document to markdown:

```bash
# Convert document to markdown
python -m markitdown path-to-file.pptx
```

#### Raw XML access

You need raw XML access for: comments, speaker notes, slide layouts, animations, design elements, and complex formatting. For any of these features, you'll need to unpack a presentation and read its raw XML contents.

##### Key file structures

- `ppt/presentation.xml` - Main presentation metadata and slide references
- `ppt/slides/slide{N}.xml` - Individual slide contents (slide1.xml, slide2.xml, etc.)
- `ppt/notesSlides/notesSlide{N}.xml` - Speaker notes for each slide
- `ppt/comments/modernComment_*.xml` - Comments for specific slides
- `ppt/slideLayouts/` - Layout templates for slides
- `ppt/slideMasters/` - Master slide templates
- `ppt/theme/` - Theme and styling information
- `ppt/media/` - Images and other media files

### Creating a new PowerPoint presentation without a template

When creating a new PowerPoint presentation from scratch, use the **html2pptx** workflow to convert HTML slides to PowerPoint with accurate positioning.

#### Design Principles

**CRITICAL**: Before creating any presentation, analyze the content and choose appropriate design elements:

1. **Consider the subject matter**: What is this presentation about? What tone, industry, or mood does it suggest?
2. **Check for branding**: If the user mentions a company/organization, consider their brand colors and identity
3. **Match palette to content**: Select colors that reflect the subject
4. **State your approach**: Explain your design choices before writing code

**Requirements**:

- State your content-informed design approach BEFORE writing code
- Use web-safe fonts only: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Georgia, Courier New, Verdana, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Impact
- Create clear visual hierarchy through size, weight, and color
- Ensure readability: strong contrast, appropriately sized text, clean alignment
- Be consistent: repeat patterns, spacing, and visual language across slides

#### Color Palette Selection

Example color palettes (use these to spark creativity):

1. **Classic Blue**: Deep navy (#1C2833), slate gray (#2E4053), silver (#AAB7B8), off-white (#F4F6F6)
2. **Teal & Coral**: Teal (#5EA8A7), deep teal (#277884), coral (#FE4447), white (#FFFFFF)
3. **Bold Red**: Red (#C0392B), bright red (#E74C3C), orange (#F39C12), yellow (#F1C40F), green (#2ECC71)
4. **Warm Blush**: Mauve (#A49393), blush (#EED6D3), rose (#E8B4B8), cream (#FAF7F2)
5. **Burgundy Luxury**: Burgundy (#5D1D2E), crimson (#951233), rust (#C15937), gold (#997929)
... and many more options available

#### Workflow

1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read `html2pptx.md` completely from start to finish.

2. Create an HTML file for each slide with proper dimensions (e.g., 720pt × 405pt for 16:9)
   - Use `<p>`, `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>` for all text content
   - Use `class="placeholder"` for areas where charts/tables will be added

3. Create and run a JavaScript file using the `html2pptx.js` library to convert HTML slides to PowerPoint and save the presentation

4. **Visual validation**: Generate thumbnails and inspect for layout issues
   - Create thumbnail grid: `python scripts/thumbnail.py output.pptx workspace/thumbnails --cols 4`
   - Read and carefully examine the thumbnail image for issues

### Editing an existing PowerPoint presentation

When editing slides in an existing PowerPoint presentation, you need to work with the raw Office Open XML (OOXML) format.

#### Workflow

1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read `ooxml.md` (~500 lines) completely from start to finish.

2. Unpack the presentation: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_dir>`

3. Edit the XML files (primarily `ppt/slides/slide{N}.xml` and related files)

4. **CRITICAL**: Validate immediately after each edit: `python ooxml/scripts/validate.py <dir> --original <file>`

5. Pack the final presentation: `python ooxml/scripts/pack.py <input_directory> <office_file>`

### Creating a new PowerPoint presentation using a template

When you need to create a presentation that follows an existing template's design, you'll need to duplicate and re-arrange template slides before then replacing placeholder context.

## skill-creator

```yaml
---
name: skill-creator
description: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.
---
```

### Skill Creator

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.

#### About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific domains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

##### What Skills Provide

1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

#### Core Principles

##### Concise is Key

The context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.

**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: "Does Claude really need this explanation?" and "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

##### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:

**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.

**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.

**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.

##### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/ - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/ - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/ - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

##### SKILL.md (required)

Every SKILL.md consists of:

- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.
- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).

##### Bundled Resources (optional)

###### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context

###### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.

- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md

###### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates

##### What to Not Include in a Skill

A skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:

- README.md
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- etc.

#### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)

#### Skill Creation Process

Skill creation involves these steps:

1. Understand the skill with concrete examples
2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)
3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)
4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)
5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)
6. Iterate based on real usage

## slack-gif-creator

| name | description | license |
|------|-------------|---------|
| slack-gif-creator | Knowledge and utilities for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack. Provides constraints, validation tools, and animation concepts. Use when users request animated GIFs for Slack like "make me a GIF of X doing Y for Slack." | Complete terms in LICENSE.txt |

### Slack GIF Creator

A toolkit providing utilities and knowledge for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack.

#### Slack Requirements

**Dimensions:**
- Emoji GIFs: 128x128 (recommended)
- Message GIFs: 480x480

**Parameters:**
- FPS: 10-30 (lower is smaller file size)
- Colors: 48-128 (fewer = smaller file size)
- Duration: Keep under 3 seconds for emoji GIFs

#### Core Workflow

```python
from core.gif_builder import GIFBuilder
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

# 1. Create builder
builder = GIFBuilder(width=128, height=128, fps=10)

# 2. Generate frames
for i in range(12):
    frame = Image.new('RGB', (128, 128), (240, 248, 255))
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(frame)

    # Draw your animation using PIL primitives
    # (circles, polygons, lines, etc.)

    builder.add_frame(frame)

# 3. Save with optimization
builder.save('output.gif', num_colors=48, optimize_for_emoji=True)
```

#### Drawing Graphics

##### Working with User-Uploaded Images

If a user uploads an image, consider whether they want to:
- **Use it directly** (e.g., "animate this", "split this into frames")
- **Use it as inspiration** (e.g., "make something like this")

##### Drawing from Scratch

When drawing graphics from scratch, use PIL ImageDraw primitives:

```python
from PIL import ImageDraw

draw = ImageDraw.Draw(frame)

# Circles/ovals
draw.ellipse([x1, y1, x2, y2], fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)

# Stars, triangles, any polygon
points = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), ...]
draw.polygon(points, fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)

# Lines
draw.line([(x1, y1), (x2, y2)], fill=(r, g, b), width=5)

# Rectangles
draw.rectangle([x1, y1, x2, y2], fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)
```

#### Available Utilities

##### GIFBuilder (core.gif_builder)

Assembles frames and optimizes for Slack:

```python
builder = GIFBuilder(width=128, height=128, fps=10)
builder.add_frame(frame)  # Add PIL Image
builder.add_frames(frames)  # Add list of frames
builder.save('out.gif', num_colors=48, optimize_for_emoji=True, remove_duplicates=True)
```

##### Validators (core.validators)

Check if GIF meets Slack requirements:

```python
from core.validators import validate_gif, is_slack_ready

# Detailed validation
passes, info = validate_gif('my.gif', is_emoji=True, verbose=True)

# Quick check
if is_slack_ready('my.gif'):
    print("Ready!")
```

##### Easing Functions (core.easing)

Smooth motion instead of linear:

```python
from core.easing import interpolate

# Progress from 0.0 to 1.0
t = i / (num_frames - 1)

# Apply easing
y = interpolate(start=0, end=400, t=t, easing='ease_out')

# Available: linear, ease_in, ease_out, ease_in_out,
# bounce_out, elastic_out, back_out
```

#### Animation Concepts

##### Shake/Vibrate

Offset object position with oscillation:
- Use `math.sin()` or `math.cos()` with frame index
- Add small random variations for natural feel
- Apply to x and/or y position

##### Pulse/Heartbeat

Scale object size rhythmically:
- Use `math.sin(t * frequency * 2 * math.pi)` for smooth pulse
- For heartbeat: two quick pulses then pause (adjust sine wave)
- Scale between 0.8 and 1.2 of base size

##### Bounce

Object falls and bounces:
- Use `interpolate()` with `easing='bounce_out'` for landing
- Use `easing='ease_in'` for falling (accelerating)
- Apply gravity by increasing y velocity each frame

##### Spin/Rotate

Rotate object around center:
- PIL: `image.rotate(angle, resample=Image.BICUBIC)`
- For wobble: use sine wave for angle instead of linear

##### Fade In/Out

Gradually appear or disappear:
- Create RGBA image, adjust alpha channel
- Or use `Image.blend(image1, image2, alpha)`
- Fade in: alpha from 0 to 1
- Fade out: alpha from 1 to 0

##### Slide

Move object from off-screen to position:
- Start position: outside frame bounds
- End position: target location
- Use `interpolate()` with `easing='ease_out'` for smooth stop
- For overshoot: use `easing='back_out'`

##### Zoom

Scale and position for zoom effect:
- Zoom in: scale from 0.1 to 2.0, crop center
- Zoom out: scale from 2.0 to 1.0
- Can add motion blur for drama (PIL filter)

##### Explode/Particle Burst

Create particles radiating outward:
- Generate particles with random angles and velocities
- Update each particle: `x += vx`, `y += vy`
- Add gravity: `vy += gravity_constant`
- Fade out particles over time (reduce alpha)

#### Philosophy

This skill provides:
- **Knowledge**: Slack's requirements and animation concepts
- **Utilities**: GIFBuilder, validators, easing functions
- **Flexibility**: Create the animation logic using PIL primitives

It does NOT provide:
- Rigid animation templates or pre-made functions
- Emoji font rendering (unreliable across platforms)
- A library of pre-packaged graphics built into the skill

#### Dependencies

```
pip install pillow imageio numpy
```

## theme-factory

| name | description | license |
|------|-------------|---------|
| theme-factory | Toolkit for styling artifacts with a theme. These artifacts can be slides, docs, reportings, HTML landing pages, etc. There are 10 pre-set themes with colors/fonts that you can apply to any artifact that has been creating, or can generate a new theme on-the-fly. | Complete terms in LICENSE.txt |

### Theme Factory Skill

This skill provides a curated collection of professional font and color themes themes, each with carefully selected color palettes and font pairings. Once a theme is chosen, it can be applied to any artifact.

#### Purpose

To apply consistent, professional styling to presentation slide decks, use this skill. Each theme includes:

- A cohesive color palette with hex codes
- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text
- A distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences

#### Usage Instructions

To apply styling to a slide deck or other artifact:

1. **Show the theme showcase**: Display the `theme-showcase.pdf` file to allow users to see all available themes visually. Do not make any modifications to it; simply show the file for viewing.
2. **Ask for their choice**: Ask which theme to apply to the deck
3. **Wait for selection**: Get explicit confirmation about the chosen theme
4. **Apply the theme**: Once a theme has been chosen, apply the selected theme's colors and fonts to the deck/artifact

#### Themes Available

The following 10 themes are available, each showcased in `theme-showcase.pdf`:

1. **Ocean Depths** - Professional and calming maritime theme
2. **Sunset Boulevard** - Warm and vibrant sunset colors
3. **Forest Canopy** - Natural and grounded earth tones

10. **Midnight Galaxy** - Dramatic and cosmic deep tones

#### Theme Details

Each theme is defined in the `themes/` directory with complete specifications including:

- Cohesive color palette with hex codes
- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text
- Distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences

#### Application Process

After a preferred theme is selected:

1. Read the corresponding theme file from the `themes/` directory
2. Apply the specified colors and fonts consistently throughout the deck
3. Ensure proper contrast and readability
4. Maintain the theme's visual identity across all slides

#### Create your Own Theme

To handle cases where none of the existing themes work for an artifact, create a custom theme. Based on provided inputs, generate a new theme similar to the ones above. Give the theme a similar name describing what the font/color combinations represent. Use any basic description provided to choose appropriate colors/fonts. After generating the theme, show it for review and verification. Following that, apply the theme as described above.

## web-artifacts-builder

| name | description | license |
|------|-------------|---------|
| web-artifacts-builder | Suite of tools for creating elaborate, multi-component claude.ai HTML artifacts using modern frontend web technologies (React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui). Use for complex artifacts requiring state management, routing, or shadcn/ui components - not for simple single-file HTML/JSX artifacts. | Complete terms in LICENSE.txt |

### Web Artifacts Builder

To build powerful frontend claude.ai artifacts, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the frontend repo using `scripts/init-artifact.sh`
2. Develop your artifact by editing the generated code
3. Bundle all code into a single HTML file using `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`
4. Display artifact to user
5. (Optional) Test the artifact

**Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

#### Design & Style Guidelines

VERY IMPORTANT: To avoid what is often referred to as "AI slop", avoid using excessive centered layouts, purple gradients, uniform rounded corners, and Inter font.

#### Quick Start

##### Step 1: Initialize Project

Run the initialization script to create a new React project:

```bash
bash scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

This creates a fully configured project with:

- React + TypeScript (via Vite)
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with shadcn/ui theming system
- Path aliases (`@/`) configured
- 40+ shadcn/ui components pre-installed
- All Radix UI dependencies included
- Parcel configured for bundling (via .parcelrc)
- Node 18+ compatibility (auto-detects and pins Vite version)

##### Step 2: Develop Your Artifact

To build the artifact, edit the generated files. See **Common Development Tasks** below for guidance.

##### Step 3: Bundle to Single HTML File

To bundle the React app into a single HTML artifact:

```bash
bash scripts/bundle-artifact.sh
```

This creates `bundle.html` - a self-contained artifact with all JavaScript, CSS, and dependencies inlined. This file can be directly shared in Claude conversations as an artifact.

**Requirements**: Your project must have an `index.html` in the root directory.

##### Step 4: Share Artifact with User

Finally, share the bundled HTML file in conversation with the user so they can view it as an artifact.

##### Step 5: Testing/Visualizing the Artifact (Optional)

Note: This is a completely optional step. Only perform if necessary or requested.

To test/visualize the artifact, use available tools (including other Skills or built-in tools like Playwright or Puppeteer). In general, avoid testing the artifact upfront as it adds latency between the request and when the finished artifact can be seen. Test later, after presenting the artifact, if requested or if issues arise.

## webapp-testing

| name | description | license |
|------|-------------|---------|
| webapp-testing | Toolkit for interacting with and testing local web applications using Playwright. Supports verifying frontend functionality, debugging UI behavior, capturing browser screenshots, and viewing browser logs. | Complete terms in LICENSE.txt |

### Web Application Testing

To test local web applications, write native Python Playwright scripts.

**Helper Scripts Available**:
- `scripts/with_server.py` - Manages server lifecycle (supports multiple servers)

**Always run scripts with `--help` first** to see usage. DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is absolutely necessary.

#### Decision Tree: Choosing Your Approach

```
User task → Is it static HTML?
    ├─ Yes → Read HTML file directly to identify selectors
    │   ├─ Success → Write Playwright script using selectors
    │   └─ Fails/Incomplete → Treat as dynamic (below)
    │
    └─ No (dynamic webapp) → Is the server already running?
        ├─ No → Run: python scripts/with_server.py --help
        │       Then use the helper + write simplified Playwright script
        │
        └─ Yes → Reconnaissance-then-action:
                 1. Navigate and wait for networkidle
                 2. Take screenshot or inspect DOM
                 3. Identify selectors from rendered state
                 4. Execute actions with discovered selectors
```

#### Example: Using with_server.py

To start a server, run `--help` first, then use the helper:

**Single server:**
```bash
python scripts/with_server.py --server "npm run dev" --port 5173 -- python your_automation.py
```

**Multiple servers (e.g., backend + frontend):**
```bash
python scripts/with_server.py \
    --server "cd backend && python server.py" --port 3000 \
    --server "cd frontend && npm run dev" --port 5173 \
    -- python your_automation.py
```

To create an automation script, include only Playwright logic (servers are managed automatically):

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)  # Always launch chromium in headless mode
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto('http://localhost:5173')  # Server already running and ready
    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')  # CRITICAL: Wait for JS to execute
    # ... your automation logic
    browser.close()
```

#### Reconnaissance-Then-Action Pattern

1. **Inspect rendered DOM**:
```python
page.screenshot(path='/tmp/inspect.png', full_page=True)
content = page.content()
page.locator('button').all()
```

2. **Identify selectors** from inspection results

3. **Execute actions** using discovered selectors

#### Common Pitfall

- **Don't** inspect the DOM before waiting for `networkidle` on dynamic apps
- **Do** wait for `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` before inspection

#### Best Practices

- **Use bundled scripts as black boxes** - To accomplish a task, consider whether one of the scripts available in `scripts/` can help.
- Use `sync_playwright()` for synchronous scripts
- Always close the browser when done
- Use descriptive selectors: `text=`, `role=`, CSS selectors, or IDs
- Add appropriate waits: `page.wait_for_selector()` or `page.wait_for_timeout()`

## xlsx

| name | description | license |
| --- | --- | --- |
| xlsx | Comprehensive spreadsheet creation, editing, and analysis with support for formulas, formatting, data analysis, and visualization. When Claude needs to work with spreadsheets (.xlsx, .xlsm, .csv, .tsv, etc) for: (1) Creating new spreadsheets with formulas and formatting, (2) Reading or analyzing data, (3) Modify existing spreadsheets while preserving formulas, (4) Data analysis and visualization in spreadsheets, or (5) Recalculating formulas | Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has complete terms |

### Requirements for Outputs

#### All Excel files

##### Zero Formula Errors

- Every Excel model MUST be delivered with ZERO formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #N/A, #NAME?)

##### Preserve Existing Templates (when updating templates)

- Study and EXACTLY match existing format, style, and conventions when modifying files
- Never impose standardized formatting on files with established patterns
- Existing template conventions ALWAYS override these guidelines

#### Financial models

##### Color Coding Standards

Unless otherwise stated by the user or existing template

###### Industry-Standard Color Conventions

- **Blue text (RGB: 0,0,255)**: Hardcoded inputs, and numbers users will change for scenarios
- **Black text (RGB: 0,0,0)**: ALL formulas and calculations
- **Green text (RGB: 0,128,0)**: Links pulling from other worksheets within same workbook
- **Red text (RGB: 255,0,0)**: External links to other files
- **Yellow background (RGB: 255,255,0)**: Key assumptions needing attention or cells that need to be updated

##### Number Formatting Standards

###### Required Format Rules

- **Years**: Format as text strings (e.g., "2024" not "2,024")
- **Currency**: Use $#,##0 format; ALWAYS specify units in headers ("Revenue ($mm)")
- **Zeros**: Use number formatting to make all zeros "-", including percentages
- **Percentages**: Default to 0.0% format (one decimal)
- **Multiples**: Format as 0.0x for valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA, P/E)
- **Negative numbers**: Use parentheses (123) not minus -123

##### Formula Construction Rules

###### Assumptions Placement

- Place ALL assumptions (growth rates, margins, multiples, etc.) in separate assumption cells
- Use cell references instead of hardcoded values in formulas
- Example: Use =B5*(1+$B$6) instead of =B5*1.05

### CRITICAL: Use Formulas, Not Hardcoded Values

**Always use Excel formulas instead of calculating values in Python and hardcoding them.** This ensures the spreadsheet remains dynamic and updateable.

#### WRONG - Hardcoding Calculated Values

```python
# Bad: Calculating in Python and hardcoding result
total = df['Sales'].sum()
sheet['B10'] = total  # Hardcodes 5000

# Bad: Computing growth rate in Python
growth = (df.iloc[-1]['Revenue'] - df.iloc[0]['Revenue']) / df.iloc[0]['Revenue']
sheet['C5'] = growth  # Hardcodes 0.15
```

#### CORRECT - Using Excel Formulas

```python
# Good: Let Excel calculate the sum
sheet['B10'] = '=SUM(B2:B9)'

# Good: Growth rate as Excel formula
sheet['C5'] = '=(C4-C2)/C2'

# Good: Average using Excel function
sheet['D20'] = '=AVERAGE(D2:D19)'
```

### Common Workflow

1. **Choose tool**: pandas for data, openpyxl for formulas/formatting
2. **Create/Load**: Create new workbook or load existing file
3. **Modify**: Add/edit data, formulas, and formatting
4. **Save**: Write to file
5. **Recalculate formulas (MANDATORY IF USING FORMULAS)**: Use the recalc.py script
   ```
   python recalc.py output.xlsx
   ```
6. **Verify and fix any errors**

### Creating new Excel files

```python
# Using openpyxl for formulas and formatting
from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.styles import Font, PatternFill, Alignment

wb = Workbook()
sheet = wb.active

# Add data
sheet['A1'] = 'Hello'
sheet['B1'] = 'World'
sheet.append(['Row', 'of', 'data'])

# Add formula
sheet['B2'] = '=SUM(A1:A10)'

# Formatting
sheet['A1'].font = Font(bold=True, color='FF0000')
sheet['A1'].fill = PatternFill('solid', start_color='FFFF00')
sheet['A1'].alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center')

# Column width
sheet.column_dimensions['A'].width = 20

wb.save('output.xlsx')
```

### Editing existing Excel files

```python
# Using openpyxl to preserve formulas and formatting
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Load existing file
wb = load_workbook('existing.xlsx')
sheet = wb.active  # or wb['SheetName'] for specific sheet

# Working with multiple sheets
for sheet_name in wb.sheetnames:
    sheet = wb[sheet_name]
    print(f"Sheet: {sheet_name}")

# Modify cells
sheet['A1'] = 'New Value'
sheet.insert_rows(2)  # Insert row at position 2
sheet.delete_cols(3)  # Delete column 3

# Add new sheet
new_sheet = wb.create_sheet('NewSheet')
new_sheet['A1'] = 'Data'

wb.save('modified.xlsx')
```

### Recalculating formulas

Excel files created or modified by openpyxl contain formulas as strings but not calculated values. Use the provided `recalc.py` script to recalculate formulas:

```
python recalc.py <excel_file> [timeout_seconds]
```

The script:

- Automatically sets up LibreOffice macro on first run
- Recalculates all formulas in all sheets
- Scans ALL cells for Excel errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.)
- Returns JSON with detailed error locations and counts
- Works on both Linux and macOS

### Best Practices

#### Library Selection

- **pandas**: Best for data analysis, bulk operations, and simple data export
- **openpyxl**: Best for complex formatting, formulas, and Excel-specific features

#### Working with openpyxl

- Cell indices are 1-based (row=1, column=1 refers to cell A1)
- Use `data_only=True` to read calculated values: `load_workbook('file.xlsx', data_only=True)`
- **Warning**: If opened with `data_only=True` and saved, formulas are replaced with values and permanently lost
- For large files: Use `read_only=True` for reading or `write_only=True` for writing
- Formulas are preserved but not evaluated - use recalc.py to update values

#### Working with pandas

- Specify data types to avoid inference issues: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', dtype={'id': str})`
- For large files, read specific columns: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', usecols=['A', 'C', 'E'])`
- Handle dates properly: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', parse_dates=['date_column'])`
